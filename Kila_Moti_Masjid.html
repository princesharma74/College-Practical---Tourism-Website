        <h1>Kila Moti Masjid</h1>
        The Kila Koti Masjid is one of the most important and venerated mosques in Patna, the capital city of Bihar in eastern India. The mosque is located in the old city, near the Chhota Imambara. It was built in 1622 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, and is one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in Patna. The mosque has five domes, each with a balcony, and is decorated with intricate calligraphy and tilework. It is said that Shah Jahan himself oversaw the construction of the mosque, and was so pleased with the result that he ordered that no other mosque be built in Patna.
        <br><br>
        The Kila Koti Masjid is an important site of pilgrimage for Muslims from all over India, and is particularly crowded during the holy month of Ramadan. The mosque is also a popular tourist attraction, and is one of the most photographed buildings in Patna.

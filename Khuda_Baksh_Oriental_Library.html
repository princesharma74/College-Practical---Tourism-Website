    <h1>Khuda Baksh Oriental Library</h1>
    <p>
        The Khuda Baksh Oriental Library is a public library located in the city of Patna, in the Indian state of Bihar. The library is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Asia, and houses a collection of over 2.5 million manuscripts, books, and other documents in a variety of languages, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hindi, Sanskrit, and Tibetan.
<br><br>
The library was founded in 1891 by Khuda Baksh, a wealthy landowner and philanthropist from the city of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. Baksh was a passionate collector of books and manuscripts, and had amassed a large collection over the course of his lifetime. Upon his death, he bequeathed his entire collection to the people of Patna, with the stipulation that it be housed in a public library for the benefit of all.
<br><br>
The library is named after its founder, and is currently run by the Khuda Baksh Foundation, a trust established for the preservation and promotion of the library's collection. The library is open to the public free of charge, and houses a reading room, a reference section, and a museum.
<br><br>
The Khuda Baksh Oriental Library is an important institution for the study of the history and culture of the Indian subcontinent. The library's collection is particularly rich in Islamic manuscripts, and includes many rare and valuable items. The library has been described as "a veritable treasure trove of Oriental learning", and attracts scholars from all over the world.

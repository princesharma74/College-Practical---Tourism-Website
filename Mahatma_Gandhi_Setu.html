        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi Setu</h1>
        Mahatma Gandhi Setu, also known as Gandhigram Setu, is a bridge over the river Ganges in Patna, the capital of the Indian state of Bihar. It is one of the longest river bridges in the world. The bridge is named after Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. It was inaugurated by then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi on 10 May 1982. The bridge links Patna on the south bank of the Ganges with Hajipur on the north bank. The total length of the bridge is 5,750 metres (18,860 ft) and it is the second-longest cantilever bridge in the world.
        <br><br>
        The bridge has been built to withstand the impact of floods. The pillar foundations have been designed to rest on the river bed, thereby minimizing the resistance to scouring. The bridge has been designed for a ultimate load of 14,000 tonnes, which is well above the designing standard of Indian Roads Congress. The bridge has ahaveled roadway of 7.5 metres (25 ft) width with a footpath on either side. The bridge has been designed for a speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph).
        <br><br>
        The Mahatma Gandhi Setu is an important link in the National Highway system of India. It is part of the Golden Quadrilateral project. The bridge has reduced the distance between Patna and Delhi by more than 400 kilometres (250 mi). It has also shortened the distance between Kolkata and Delhi by about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi).

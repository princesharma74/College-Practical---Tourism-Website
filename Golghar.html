        <h1>Golghar</h1>
        Golghar,Patna is a famous historical and tourist place in Patna, Bihar, India. It is a large granary constructed by Captain John Garstin of the British East India Company in 1786. The Golghar has a height of 29.1 m from the ground level and a staircase inside that encircles the structure providing access to the top. There is a porthole at the top from which one can have a bird's eye view of the entire city and the Ganges river. The Golghar was built to store grains in the event of a famine. The Golghar has been used for many purposes since its construction. It was used as a platform to watch the first total solar eclipse of 29th March 1868. It was also used as a lighthouse and a signals post. The Golghar has become a tourist attraction in recent years.
        <br><br>
        This Granary was built in 1786 by Captain John Garstin of the British East India Company. The Golghar has a height of 125 feet and a diameter of approximately 140 feet. There is a flight of stairs leading to the top of the Golghar, from where one can have a panoramic view of the city and the river Ganges. The Golghar was built to store grains in case of a famine. However, the grain storage house never served its purpose as a famine never struck the city of Patna.
